# BTC-prediction
This project is a time series prediction for bitcoin. 
I have developed a base model (Naive forecast) and evaluated it.
Then I have tried  a dense model with window size=7 that predicts the next price (horizon=1).
I have developed several other models including CNN and N-BEATS models and tuned the hyperparameters for N-BEATS algorithm.
Then, I tried an ensemble model and encountered the turkey problem.
Finally, I have compard the models based on performance using mae,	mse,	rmse,	mape and mase.
